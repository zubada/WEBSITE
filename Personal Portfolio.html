    <h1>Wan-Lun Tsai</h1>
    <p>Hello! Welcome to my personal website!</p>
    <p>My name is Wan-Lun Tsai. Two years ago, I made a decision to step out of my comfort zone and now I am in America for pursuing Masterâ€™s degree in Statistics in University of Michigan. </p>
    <p>For the past few years of studying Statistics, I have been trained to specialize in big data analysis by utilizing R, SAS, Stata, SQL and Python. I am pretty interested in data mining, after taking the related course in school, I also took some courses about deep learning on Coursea to improve my knowledge and skill. If you are interested in me, or have questions about me, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
